Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

# How to Run the Program:

1. Before you run the program you should run the "make" command to ensure that all files are up to date and compiled.
2. enter "./uimain" into the terminal to begin the program.
 - A "$" will appear to show that the program has started.
3. Enter any string you'd like and press enter on your keyboard.
 - The program will then tokenize your string by seperating each word and converting them into tokens.

# Things to Know:
 - To exit or terminate the program enter "exit". Ex. "$ exit"
 - To pull up history and see what you have entered, enter "history". Ex. "$ history"
 - To pull up a specific instance of history enter "!" imediatly followed by a number. Ex."$ !4"
 - If you enter a string with over 100 characters in it, the program will only tokenize the first 100 characters.
